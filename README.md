## Credits
I drew inspiration for this idea from VikramadityaDev's app structure. Although I used the same basic framework, I customized the internal modules using BrainFuison to achieve the exact results I was aiming for. I'm not great at design myself, so I want to give all the credit to VikramadityaDev for their amazing design skills.
